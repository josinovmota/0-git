# What are Protected Branches

Protected Branches are branches that have some rules to be accepted

- Block direct pushes, so no one can push it without a Pull Request
- Require a Review of the Pull Request
- Prevent branch Deletion
- Require some CI/CD tests in order to merge
- Disallow force pushes
