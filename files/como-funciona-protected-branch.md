# What are Protected Branches

Protected Branches are branches that have some additional rules, for example:

- Block direct pushes, so no one can push to it without a pull request
- Require a Review of the pull request
- Prevent branch deletion
- Require a passing CI/CD pipeline
- Disallow force pushes
